/**
 * Builds a web-standard fetch handler — `(request: Request) => Promise<Response>` — serving the
 * same HttpApi routes as the Node server process without binding a port, owning a listener, or
 * installing signal handlers. This is the entry for runtimes that hand requests to the embedder
 * instead of letting it listen: workerd (Workers and Durable Objects), Deno.serve, Bun.serve, or
 * a test harness.
 *
 * The application layer builds EAGERLY, inside the caller's `Scope`, before the handler is
 * returned. Do not convert this to a lazy first-request build: on workerd, a first request that
 * aborts mid-build interrupts the layer construction and wedges every subsequent request
 * (Effect-TS/effect#6319 class). The embedder owns the lifecycle — closing the scope releases
 * the application layer.
 *
 * Auth follows `createRoutes` semantics: `options.password` enforces Basic auth; omitting it
 * serves unauthenticated, so an embedder without a password must front the handler with its own
 * access control.
 *
 * Sessions whose execution claim was never released resume once the layer is built, exactly as
 * the Node server process does: a runtime that dies without teardown — an evicted Durable
 * Object leaves the same durable signature as a killed process — replays orphaned turns on the
 * next boot, and the sweep is a no-op when nothing is suspended.

// so a burst of setter calls costs one round trip. Mirrors VS Code's Storage class.
//
// Two orderings keep the cache correct. Every local write gets a sequence number that stays
// recorded until the host acks that exact write; while recorded, nothing external may replace
// the key. Every value the cache holds also carries the host revision it came from, so an event
// that reaches this window after a newer ack or load is recognised as stale and dropped. Batches
// are posted as soon as they are cut, never behind an earlier reply, so a flush on pagehide is
// on the wire before the page goes away.

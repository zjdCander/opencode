# @opencode/sdk

In-process OpenCode host for Promise and Effect applications. The SDK executes Server's assembled HTTP router in memory, opening no listener and adding no network hop.

```ts
import { OpenCode } from "@opencode/sdk"

await using opencode = await OpenCode.create()
const session = await opencode.sessions.create({
  location: { directory: "/workspace" },
})
```

Pass imported Promise plugins in `plugins`, or register one later with `await opencode.plugin(plugin)`.

The Promise API uses the same values, errors, request options, and `AsyncIterable` streams as `@opencode/client`.

Embedded hosts are silent by default. Set `log` to receive structured log entries:

```ts
await using opencode = await OpenCode.create({
  log: {
    level: "warn",
    emit: (entry) => console.error(entry.message, entry.attributes, entry.cause),
  },
})
```

`close()` and `Symbol.asyncDispose` release router resources, Location services, fibers, and scoped plugin registrations.

## Session-Selected Plugins

Use `instances` when Sessions in the same directory need different application plugins. The application selects a stable key from Session metadata; the SDK constructs and caches an instance for that key and the Session's current Location.

```ts
import { OpenCode } from "@opencode/sdk"
import { threads } from "./threads"
import { slackPlugin } from "./slack-plugin"

await using opencode = await OpenCode.create({
  database: { path: "./sessions.db" },
  instances: {
    key(session) {
      const threadID = session.metadata?.threadID
      if (typeof threadID !== "string") throw new Error("Session has no thread ID")
      return threadID
    },
    configure: async (threadID) => ({
      plugins: [slackPlugin(await threads.get(threadID))],
    }),
  },
})

const session = await opencode.sessions.create({
  location: { directory: "/workspace" },
  metadata: { threadID: "thread-42" },
})
await opencode.sessions.prompt({ sessionID: session.id, text: "Review the changes" })
```

`threads` and `slackPlugin` are application-owned modules. `key` is synchronous and should only select identity, not initialize plugins. `configure` returns plugin definitions; their setup receives the selected instance's `ctx.location`.

- The same key and Location share one live instance. Different directories or workspace IDs always select separate instances, even with the same application key.
- `configure` runs on a cache miss, not on each prompt. Loaded instances live until the host closes; change the application key or restart the host to reconstruct their birth configuration. Plugin transforms and reloads remain available within that lifetime.
- Session metadata, message, inbox, and context reads do not initialize plugins; permission and form lists read instance services and therefore acquire the Session's instance. Configuration failure or a supplied plugin reported as failed after activation, including initial setup failure or an ID that collides with a host `plugins` entry (the host plugin keeps the ID), prevents capability acquisition, without falling back to another instance. A subsequent request can retry a failed construction.
- Existing HTTP prompt middleware also acquires capabilities for an idempotent retry. After restart, that retry can reconstruct plugins before returning the original admission; prompt preparation and hooks do not rerun. Configuration failure can therefore block the retry even when its input was already saved.
- Instance selection is not an authorization or storage-isolation boundary. Plugin Session APIs and the existing plugin-ID-based durable storage retain their normal scope.
- Omitting `instances` preserves default Location sharing. Host-wide plugins remain separate from Session-selected configuration; retain host-wide catalog policy when locationless generation needs it.

### Restart and Lifetime

The selector is installed before automatic recovery starts. Its callbacks must be able to load application data without depending on the returned `opencode` handle or a later registration call. Functions are reconstructed, not serialized.

Use a persistent `database.path` to recover Sessions after restart; the default database is in memory. Workerd uses its injected Durable Object storage. After restart, the next capability-dependent operation or recovery drain rebuilds the selected instance from saved Session metadata and application data.

Promise plugin resources should be acquired in `setup` and released by its cleanup function. Effect configuration can acquire resources in its supplied instance Scope and require services provided to the SDK entrypoint (see the Effect section).

## Workerd

Use the Workerd entrypoint inside a Cloudflare Durable Object. Hold one host for the lifetime of the object instance rather than creating one per request.

```ts
import { OpenCodeWorkerd } from "@opencode/sdk/workerd"
import myPlugin from "./my-plugin"

export class OpenCodeDO {
  private readonly opencode: Promise<OpenCodeWorkerd.Interface>

  constructor(state: DurableObjectState) {
    this.opencode = state.blockConcurrencyWhile(() =>
      OpenCodeWorkerd.create({
        storage: state.storage,
        config: { default_agent: "build" },
        plugins: [myPlugin],
      }),
    )
  }

  async fetch() {
    const opencode = await this.opencode
    return Response.json(await opencode.server.info())
  }
}
```

`blockConcurrencyWhile` keeps every Durable Object event out until the host is ready and resets the object if initialization fails. The retained Promise gives request handlers direct access to the same host after startup. Configuration is a typed JavaScript object, and plugins are imported values bundled with the Worker.

## Effect

The Effect-native API remains available from `@opencode/sdk/effect`:

```ts
import { OpenCode } from "@opencode/sdk/effect"

const opencode = yield * OpenCode.create()
const session = yield * opencode.sessions.get({ sessionID })
```

The Effect Workerd entrypoint is `@opencode/sdk/workerd/effect`.

Effect configuration uses the same keys and lifetime rules, with canonical `Session.Info` values and an Effect-returning factory. `configure` may require services; `OpenCode.create` and `OpenCode.layer` carry those requirements, so the application satisfies them where it builds the SDK, as with any other Effect callback:

```ts
import { OpenCode } from "@opencode/sdk/effect"
import { Effect, Layer, Schema } from "effect"
import { Threads } from "./threads-effect"
import { slackPlugin } from "./slack-plugin-effect"

const threadMetadata = Schema.decodeUnknownSync(Schema.Struct({ threadID: Schema.String }))
const opencode = OpenCode.layer({
  database: { path: "./sessions.db" },
  instances: {
    key: (session) => threadMetadata(session.metadata).threadID,
    configure: (threadID) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        const threads = yield* Threads
        return { plugins: [slackPlugin(yield* threads.get(threadID))] }
      }),
  },
}).pipe(Layer.provide(Threads.layer))
```

Resources acquired in `configure` still belong to the instance, not to the Scope the SDK was built in. Both Workerd entrypoints also accept `instances`. The public `OpenCode.InstanceOptions` and `OpenCode.InstanceConfiguration` types describe the corresponding Promise or Effect callbacks.

## Objective
- [one or two brief sentences describing what the user is trying to accomplish]

## Requirements
- [constraints, preferences, requirements, and scope boundaries stated by the user, or "(none)"]

## Decisions
- [decisions already made and why, or "(none)"]

## Work State
Break the objective into smaller goals and report which are completed, which are being worked on, and which are blocked.
### Completed
- [goals that have been completed; otherwise "(none)"]

### Active
- [goals currently being worked on; otherwise "(none)"]

### Blocked
- [anything blocking progress, and why; otherwise "(none)"]

## Next Move
1. [ordered list of next actions, or "(none)"]

## Relevant Files
List the files and directories, other than the current working directory, that another agent would need to open to continue this work. Include at most 15, most important first. Do not list every file that was read or changed. Include paths outside the current working directory when relevant. If none, write "(none)".
- \`[file or directory path]\`: [brief reason it matters]

## Important Context
- [facts the next agent cannot continue without and cannot easily find on its own; or "(none)"]

- Preserve exact file paths, symbols, commands, error strings, URLs, and identifiers.
- Carry forward only user questions or requests that remain unanswered or require further action. Do not repeat ones that newer history has answered or resolved. Preserve exact wording when carrying one forward.
- Preserve consequential workflow state, including whether changes are uncommitted, committed, pushed, under review, or merged.
- Do not mention the summary process or that context was compacted.`

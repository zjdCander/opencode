## Localization

- NEVER hardcode user-visible English strings in production code. ALWAYS use an i18n key for component defaults, visible copy, placeholders, accessible labels, tooltips, dialogs, toasts, empty states, and displayed errors.
- Feature work adds English source strings only. Leave non-English keys absent so the runtime English fallback applies; translations land separately after language review.
- Render count-sensitive copy through `plural(baseKey, count, params)`. Never select or pass `.zero`, `.one`, `.two`, `.few`, `.many`, or `.other` variants to `t(...)`; `pluralForm(...)` is reserved for components that animate individual grammatical forms.
- When migrating existing copy to i18n, preserve the English text byte-for-byte unless the task explicitly requests a copy change.
- NEVER change existing English text or English keys to facilitate translation. English is intentional, designer-written source copy; adapt locale-specific translations and i18n mechanics around it.
- Use `tDynamic(...)` when runtime-generated English source copy has keyed non-English alternatives. Do not branch on the active locale in feature code.
- Do not translate from model knowledge alone. Verify terminology and grammar with Unicode CLDR locale/plural data, Microsoft Localization Style Guides and terminology, Apple localization/style guidance and localized platform UI, Mozilla localization style guides, Mozilla Pontoon, and the Firefox localization corpus at `github.com/mozilla-l10n/firefox-l10n`.
- For developer-facing terminology, prefer established usage in the target language's developer community over literal translations. Cross-check maintained Firefox, KDE, and VS Code localizations, using at least two independent corpora when available. Keep established English loanwords and acronyms instead of inventing unfamiliar terms.
- Translate whole UI phrases in context rather than substituting glossary words. Audit recurring concepts for consistency and review every exact-English value; retain it only when it is an intentional product/provider/tool name, URL, code token, keyboard legend, acronym, asset name, or established borrowing.
- Record the corpora used and flag uncertain or regional terminology in review notes.
- Also use the relevant language authority or official dictionary for the locale (for example RAE/Fundéu, FranceTerme, Duden, TDK, Kotus/Kielitoimiston sanakirja, Språkrådet/Bokmålsordboka, Rada Języka Polskiego/PWN, the Russian and Arabic language academies, the Ukrainian Orthography, Taiwan MOE dictionaries, or the Royal Society of Thailand). Treat the English dictionary as the semantic source of truth and preserve placeholders, code identifiers, product names, and keyboard labels.

## Typography

- Use the shared typography metrics instead of copying solid line heights from design exports: `--line-height-tight` is `12px`, `--line-height-compact` is `16px`, and `--line-height-base` is `20px`.
- Inter text at `13px` must use at least the compact `16px` line height. A `13px` solid line box can clip `g`, `j`, `p`, `q`, and `y` when the text or an ancestor truncates or hides overflow.
- Reserve `line-height: 1` and `leading-none` for non-text glyphs, icons, or deliberately reviewed display marks. Do not compensate text with transforms, negative margins, or clip-padding hacks.
- `TextShimmer` inherits font metrics. Put typography overrides on its parent when they must supersede the component defaults.

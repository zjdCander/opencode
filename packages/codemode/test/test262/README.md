# test262

Runs upstream [test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262) files verbatim through `test/test262.test.ts`. The files
themselves are not committed yet: populate them from a local checkout with

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tc39/test262 ~/development/test262
bun run script/sync-test262.ts ~/development/test262
```

Without them the runner registers no tests, so CI is unaffected. Licensed under `test/LICENSE.test262`.

## Layout

- `manifest.json` — the pinned upstream revision, which upstream directories are copied (every `built-ins` and
  `language` directory, about 14,900 files after filtering), and what is left out.
- `built-ins/`, `language/` — the copied files, mirroring upstream `test/`; gitignored.
- `skipped.txt` — vendored files that fail on a known interpreter gap, one `path  # reason` per line. They are
  skipped, and each gap is listed as unchecked in `interpreter-support.md`.
- `run.ts` — runs one file: prepends `"use strict"`, provides the harness (`assert`, `Test262Error`,
  `compareArray`, `$DONE`, `$DONOTEVALUATE`) as host globals, and interprets the file's frontmatter (`negative`,
  `flags: [async]`).

## What is not vendored

`script/sync-test262.ts` skips a file when its frontmatter declares a `flags`, `features`, or `includes` value the
manifest marks unsupported, or when its code matches one of the manifest's `boundaries` patterns. The sync checks the
checkout is at the pinned revision, so every machine runs the same files. Boundaries are
intentional limits of the interpreter, not compatibility work: classes, prototype objects, property descriptors,
accessors, boxed primitives, typed arrays and buffers, `WeakRef` and `FinalizationRegistry`, `Reflect` and `Proxy`, sloppy mode, `eval`,
`Symbol()`, and the `$262` host API. If one
of those decisions changes, delete its entry and re-sync; the tests are upstream, not lost.

## Commands

```sh
bun run script/sync-test262.ts /path/to/test262   # re-copy at the pinned revision; edit manifest.json to change scope
bun run script/test262-report.ts [--write] [dir]  # run everything, group failures by cause; --write regenerates skipped.txt
bun test test/test262.test.ts                     # what CI runs
```

When a fix makes skipped files pass, the report lists them so they can be removed from `skipped.txt`, and the
matching gap in `interpreter-support.md` is checked in the same change.

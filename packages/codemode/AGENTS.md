# @opencode/codemode

- This local package owns confined execution over explicit schema-described tools. Applications own authorization, persistence, external authority, and tool-specific delivery semantics.
- Do not add a speculative generic permission or approval policy. A host omits tools it does not expose and enforces domain authorization inside each provided tool.
- Keep Code Mode unaware of host session, channel, and conversation models. The hosting application supplies trusted execution scope around it.
- Tool schemas are the model-facing Interface. Keep arguments minimal and natural to the operation; never add unrelated IDs as ambient capability tokens.
- State model-visible diagnostics, logs, tool descriptions, and instructions directly. The execution context is already clear; do not repeat `Code Mode` or `CodeMode` unless the distinction is necessary.
- When interpreter behavior or support changes, update `interpreter-support.md` and direct tests in the same PR.
- Program values are `Value` (`src/interpreter/objects.ts`); host values are `unknown` and are copied in at the boundaries (`fromHost`, `fromJson`). Do not widen program-facing signatures back to `unknown`.
- A built-in kind of object is one `Obj` subclass (`Wrapper` for host-backed data such as Date or Map, `Opaque` for machinery such as functions and promises) that overrides `tag`, `toString`, `toPrimitive`, `inspect`, `toHost`, and `iterator` as needed. Do not add `instanceof` ladders over the built-in classes elsewhere; ask the object.

## OpenAPI

- Generate an operation only when its transport semantics are supported; otherwise return a precise `skipped` reason.
- Never guess parameter serialization or malformed security semantics. Unsupported serialization is skipped and malformed security fails closed.
- Render unresolved schema constructs as `unknown`, never as invented TypeScript names.
- Keep network reads bounded and map expected encoding, transport, and decoding failures to model-safe `ToolError` values.
- Test supported behavior directly; do not reproduce adapter algorithms in tests.

## Future Design Notes

- If a captured user-visible output channel returns (an earlier `output.text`/`output.file`/`output.image` API was removed from v1), keep `output` as its name, distinct from the program return value: `return` stays the structured result for the model, while `output.*` describes artifacts the host may render into a conversation or UI after execution. Keep this host-neutral and let applications decide how captured output is delivered. In v1, hosts collect media host-side (outside CodeMode) instead.
- Improve the failure taxonomy. Distinguish parse/compile mistakes, unsupported syntax, user-thrown errors, invalid returned data, tool refusal, tool internal failure, timeout, and genuine runtime defects so agents can recover accurately instead of treating everything as a generic execution failure.
- Report host failure messages and underlying causes rather than replacing them with generic diagnostics. Preserve interruption behavior.
- Think deliberately about richer binary boundaries before allowing `Blob`, `File`, `ArrayBuffer`, streams, or typed arrays beyond today's JSON-like values. If CodeMode supports binary tool args/results, use explicit tagged data shapes and clear size limits rather than relying on ambient runtime serialization.
- Keep host capabilities explicit. Globals such as `fetch`, `crypto`, filesystem handles, extra modules, or network clients should be opt-in runtime capabilities with obvious policy defaults, not ambient authority. Default to unavailable unless a host deliberately provides the capability.
- If `fetch` is added, model it as a host-provided outbound capability with policy controls: allowed origins, methods, headers, response size, timeout, and whether response bodies may be returned, emitted, or only summarized through a tool.

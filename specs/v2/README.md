# V2 Specifications

These documents explain V2 behavior that is difficult to recover from one source file. They are not API reference or a backlog.

## Authority

Authority follows the concern:

| Concern                                         | Owner                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HTTP operations and transport errors            | [Protocol](../../packages/protocol/src) endpoint definitions assembled by Server `HttpApi` |
| Public domain shapes and durable event payloads | [Schema](../../packages/schema/src)                                                        |
| Runtime behavior and persistence                | [Core](../../packages/core/src)                                                            |
| Contributor-critical regression guardrails      | Root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)                                                          |

Current specifications explain cross-module contracts without copying exact types. Decision records explain why a design was selected. Historical documents describe earlier states and may use obsolete names.

Generated clients follow the assembled public `HttpApi`. GitHub issues own active work; Git history preserves removed plans and scratchpads.

## Current Contracts

| Document                | Job                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Session](./session.md) | Explain prompt admission, execution, instructions, compaction, and recovery boundaries. |
| [Tools](./tools.md)     | Explain tool construction, registration, execution, and outcome laws.                   |

## Decision Records

| Document                                       | Status                   | Job                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Event stream](./event-stream-architecture.md) | Accepted and implemented | Record why public events use one encoded feed with independent queues.                                    |
| [Provider policy](./provider-policy.md)        | Accepted and implemented | Allow or deny provider use and permission checks, with Console-managed statements having final authority. |

## Historical Context

| Document                                                                | Job                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Catalog/config/plugin lifecycle](./catalog-config-plugin-lifecycle.md) | Preserve the option comparison that led to replayable Location-scoped catalog transforms. |

Do not add implementation checklists here. Put actionable work in GitHub issues and package-specific contributor guidance next to the code it governs.
